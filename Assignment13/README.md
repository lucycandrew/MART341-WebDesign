## I am working on the "How to make a propor cup of tea" website, I am continuing on from Assignment 12  
--------------------------
1. At Least 4 Pages – Your website should contain a minimum of four distinct pages that align with a cohesive theme.
    - Index - home 
    - Tea - About Tea
    - Party - Tea Party 
    - Food - food for a Tea Part - I add this one 
    - I did try my best to make my website cohesive.
2. Responsive Design – Ensure the website layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
    - The website is designed to adjust smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes. Flexible layouts such as CSS Grid (.materials) and Flexbox (.section, .instruction-box) allow content to resize and reflow naturally based on screen width, preventing overflow and maintaining readability on all devices.
3. Media Queries – Use CSS media queries to make design adjustments at specific screen widths for optimal user experience on all devices.
    - CSS media queries are used to make layout adjustments at specific screen widths. Breakpoints at 900px and 600px modify layouts by stacking columns, resizing cards, and adjusting navigation alignment. These changes ensure the site remains usable and visually balanced on tablets and mobile devices.
4. Navigation Menu – Include a clear, user-friendly navigation menu to allow visitors to easily access each page of the site.
    - A clear navigation menu is included at the top of every page using the .main-nav class. The menu provides direct links to the Home page, About Tea page, and Tea Party sections. Consistent placement and hover effects improve usability and allow visitors to easily navigate the site.
5. Dropdown Menu – Add a dropdown menu within the navigation for sub-pages or sections, if applicable.
    - A dropdown menu is implemented within the navigation using a .dropdown container and a hidden .dropdown-content menu. The dropdown appears on hover and reveals Tea Party sub-pages. This is achieved using CSS positioning and the :hover selector, allowing access to sub-sections without cluttering the main navigation.
